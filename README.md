 STX-Bet Smart Contract

A **decentralized prediction market** built on the Stacks blockchain that enables users to create, join, and settle bets using STX. Outcomes are transparently recorded on-chain, and payouts are automatically distributed to winners.

---

 Features
- **Bet Creation** â€“ Any user can start a bet with custom conditions.
- **Bet Participation** â€“ Other users can place STX wagers on outcomes.
- **Outcome Resolution** â€“ Resolved by an authorized admin or oracle.
- **Automatic Payouts** â€“ Proportional STX rewards distributed instantly.
- **On-Chain Transparency** â€“ All bets, participants, and results recorded on-chain.
